# assessing the effectiveness of several remote mathematics curricula for primary school students
# 330 primary-school students are randomly assigned to one of 5 conditions
# each group contains 66 students
# there are 5 conditions
    #1) T	Traditional classroom, real-time and interactive
    #2) R	Traditional classroom, but recorded and passively watched
    #3) A	Specially-designed active learning curriculum, with additional guided online activities
    #4) Y	Specially-curated YouTube videos
    #5) W	Paper workbooks, sent via post every week
# dependent variable is engagement rating - average mathematics engagement level between 1 and 7 rated by parents
# interest: Is there evidence that the conditions differ in engagement levels?

# creating appropriate graph to visualize the data
# violin plot with SE bars would be suitable
